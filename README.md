# <h2>Hi ❄️ there. <br/><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Hello---World!-informational?logoWidth=60&style=plastic" />

<h3>Let me introduce myself.</h3>

I started my journey to development in *March, 2019*. I finished **"C# Programming" course** in  Educational Center of HTP (Minsk, Belarus) with <i>"C# Development" Certification</i>. 
I like video games and therefore I decided to become a game developer. For this reason I finished another course in  Educational Center of HTP and got 
<i>"Mobile Game Development with Unity" Certification</i>. Further I got a job in **Gismart**. <br/><br/>
:collision:Game development is a very creative sphere but extremely 
fast growing and changing. Finally I chose **web development** because it is serious direction with great oppotunities. <br/><br/> 
After attempts to learn [**ASP.NET**](https://github.com/miseinen/DinosaursShop) I tried my hand in **Ruby on Rails**. And this acquaintance was successful. 
After a month of studying Ruby on Rails with the help of Udemy and Linkedin Learning I created my own web application [CoffeeCardsBlog](https://github.com/miseinen/CoffeeCardsBlog).
<br/><br/>::octocat:IT world became my passion.
