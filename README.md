<h3>Let me introduce myselfðŸ’®.</h3>

I started my journey to development in *March, 2019*. I finished **"C# Programming" course** at the ðŸ“š[**Educational Center of HTP**](https://www.it-academy.by/about/it-academy/) (Minsk, Belarus) with <i>"C# Development" Certification</i>. 
I like video games and therefore I decided to become a game developer. For this reason I finished another course at **Educational Center of HTP** and got 
<i>"Mobile Game Development with Unity" Certification</i>. Further I got a job in ðŸŽ®[**Gismart**](https://gismart.com/). <br/><br/>
:collision:Game development is a very creative sphere but extremely 
fast growing and changing. Finally I chose **web development** because it is serious direction with great oppotunities. <br/><br/> 
After attempts to learn ðŸ“Œ[**ASP.NET**](https://github.com/miseinen/DinosaursShop) I tried my hand in **Ruby on Rails**. And this acquaintance was successful. 
After a month of studying Ruby on Rails with the help of Udemy and Linkedin Learning I created my own web application ðŸ“Œ[ **CoffeeCardsBlog** ](https://github.com/miseinen/CoffeeCardsBlog).

I am currently taking a **Ruby course** at the ðŸ“š[**Epam training center**](https://training.by/#!/About?lang=en).
<br/><br/>:octocat:IT world became my passion.
